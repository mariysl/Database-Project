STUDYBUD – Connecting people one study session at a time
Authors: Isaac Ndubuisi, Amari Gray, Jelani Lawrence, Tyee Tuberville.
Studybud aims to be a web based application designed to help students find people studying
similar subject or topics as them and partner up with them. It enables things like real-time live
chats or “huddles” with people studying the same course, subject or topic. This app aims to
function as virtual study hall where learners can ask questions, share resources, meet new
people and motivate one another.
Students who use the app can seach for study sessions happening lives through keywords,
hashtags and semantic searches.
The application is going to be built on HTML CSS AND JS AND PHP for the following reasons:
→ WE NEED TO USE PHP FOR THIS CLASS AND PHP GOES WITH HTML WELL
Key features of Studybud:
→ Live chat and study sessions: Studybud will offer real time chat functionality using web
sockets. This will allow students to communicate instantly
→ Hosting Features: People who create room, will be able to make their rooms private
(accessible only by link), kick users out, terminate the huddle, and more
→ Robust Search: Our application will allow for semantic search, and enhanced discoverability
Stretch Goal: A stretch goal of ours will be to allow for user profiles
A major issue is finding study partners that are working on the same problem you are, and
studybud will help bridge that gap while connecting people. Through discussions we have had
one of the recurring themes is finding people who share the time schedules as you do. While
students value study groups, coordinating them is often difficult – schedules clash and it can be
awkward to reach out to classmates. By providing a central hub that is accessible anytime,
StudyBuddy removes many of these barriers to collaboration
